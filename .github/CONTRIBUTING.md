### Pull requests
Use the template that has been made available for this.
#### Don't pull a request for just one or two (max. four issues). Only pull request if there are a lot of changes at once.
---
### _Commit message_
Keep it simple. 
 1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something and an `R` for removing something. 
 2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
 3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
So - for example `C: Connect4/markdown_generator.rb fix #74`. The issue itself will contains all the details.

##### Make sure you read the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Connect4/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
